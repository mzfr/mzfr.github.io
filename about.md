I use to play CTFs with [OpenToAll](https://ctftime.org/team/9135). Other than that I did [HackTheBox](http://hackthebox.eu/) or [Vulnhub](http://vulnhub.com/). Also wrote loads of writeups, mostly Vulnhub machines.

Now I make rooms on [TryHackMe](tryhackme.com/) and VMs on [Vulnhub](http://vulnhub.com/). The series that I started on Vulnhub is called [djinn](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/djinn,260/).

Also I am an eJPT(google that) and preparing for OSCP.

Recently I started to do bug bounty on various platforms like [Hackerone](hackerone.com/), [BugCrowd](Bugcrowd.com/) and [intigriti](intigriti.com/).
