## Nmap

![](images/west2/nmap.png)

There are only two ports open. We'll start our enumeration from HTTP(port 80)

***

## HTTP

![](images/west2/version.png)

There's a `CMS made simple` running with version `2.2.4`

I used gobuster to enuemrate this and there were lot of directories.

![](images/west2/gobust.png)

And in `admin/` I found a directory listening named `aspadmin`,

![](images/west2/admin-dir.png)

This dir had two files named `password.list` and `user.list`

![](images/west2/lists.png)

I used burp suite's Intruder to bruteforce the login for the CMS.
Since the `username` list was small I decided to use the username that made sense to me i.e `west` because of the name of the machine.

With username set to `west` I loaded the password list in the Intruder and started the attack.

After waiting for a while I found the creds so my hunch was right about the username.

## Exploitation

I logged in with those credentials and found that there was a plugin installed named `showtime2`.

![](images/west2/plugin.png)

I searched it with `searchsploit` and found one with metsploit.

![](images/west2/exploits.png)

I run msfconsole and used that exploit with the following options:

and with this I got the reverse shell

## Horizontal Pivilege escalation

Since we are in the system now I downloaded the enumeration script and then ran it.

With that I found that one of the file was marked as `suid`.

![](images/west2/suid.png)

I ran the command `network_info` to see what that binary does.

![](images/west2/working.png)

So it does what the name says, it prints the output of `ifconfig` command.
We can run `cat /bin/network_info` to confirm that.

![](images/west2/cat.png)

Now usually we can simply make a new file named `ifconfig` with shell in it and then run the command to get the root shell. That works because the absolute path is not given.

We can make a fake `ifconfig` file and then run the `network_info` to get a privileged shell.

In the `/tmp` folder run the following command:

* `echo "/bin/sh" > ifconfig`
* `chmod +x ifconfig`
* `export PATH=.:$PATH`

Now run the `network_info` and we'll have a shell for `wside`

## Vertical Privilege escalation.

So now we had the access to the `wside` home directory so I made a new folder name `.ssh` and added my public key in `authorized_keys` file this way I was able to login via SSH.

![](images/west2/ssh.png)

Then [@DCAU7]() found out that `wside` has access to `/etc/passwd` file so basically we can edit that file and have a new user who will have the root access.

This can be found by running `find / -user wside -type f 2>/dev/null`

![](images/west2/rights.png)

I added the following line to `/etc/passwd`

```
toor:sXuCKi7k3Xh/s:0:0::/root:/bin/bash
```

![](images/west2/new-user.png)

This entry means that we are adding a new user name `toor` which will have password `toor`.

Once we run `su toor` and enter `toor` as password we'll get the flag.

This was a nice box even though we had some issue in the starting because the original VM had issues with `network_info` file we found in the `Horizontal privilege escalation phase`. But all in all it was pretty good.
