## Nmap

Okay so other then HTTP and SSH we have SMB. So let's just start with that.

## SMB

![](images/west/shares.png)

So I logged into the `wave` share and found 2 files there.

I downloaded both the files by using the `get` command.

The `FLAG1.txt` had the first flag and credentials for the user `wavex`

`wavex:door+open`

And the message file had a message ;-)

## Privilege escalation

With the credentials we found in `FLAG1.txt` we can login via SSH.

Since I was in the system I ran the enumerations script but found nothing interesting. I tried to check the `sudo` right with `sudo -l` but `wavex` didn't had any.

Then I decided to check all the directories that are editable by `wavex`

* `find / -writeable -type d 2>/dev/null`

There was this interesting dir `usr/share/av/westsidesecret/`. In there I found a file which had credentials for `aveng`.

![](images/west/aveng-pass.png)

`aveng:kaizen+80`

I `su` to `aveng` using the credentials.

Then I checked it's `sudo` rights and this user was allowed to run all the command.

![](images/west/sudo.png)

So I did `sudo su` to become root.

Now get the damn flag.

It's definitely a good box for beginners, especially getting the root part should be fun.

Thanks to [@hashimalshareff](https://twitter.com/hashimalshareff) for this cute little box :-)
