I've been playing CTF from September 2018 and Currently I am a member of [OTA](https://opentoallctf.github.io).

## Writeups

You can find my writeups for the CTF I've participated in, [here](https://github.com/mzfr/ctf-writeups).

Also check out my writeups for the [HackTheBox](https://github.com/mzfr/HackTheBox-writeups) machines that I've tried.


## Notes

I maintain notes for all the new things I learn in CTF or while `"PWNING"` a Vulnerable machines.

Source for all of my notes can be found [here](http://github.com/mzfr/notes).

They are hosted on Gitbook So you can directly read them [here](https://mzfr.gitbook.io/ctf-notes/)
