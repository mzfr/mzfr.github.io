Just like last year this year also, I decided to do a ‚Äúyear in review‚Äù blog post. You can read the 2020 rewind here.\nChess This year I didn‚Äôt play much chess. I even stopped my premium membership on chess.com, I might have played a few games here and there. But still, I decided to do an analysis on all the bullet matches I played in 2021.\nAll my stats were exactly the same as they were in 2020 i.e I‚Äôm still playing Scandinavian opening in almost 80% of my games and I‚Äôm doing e2e4 as my first moves in almost all of my games as white.\n2021 2020 As I said in the starting I didn‚Äôt play chess much and as we can see above total game count in 2021 is almost half of what I played in 2020. Also, the heatmap shows that in 2021 I didn‚Äôt play games on regular basis. It was more like a few games in 1-2 days and then nothing for quite some time.\nSleep \u0026 Fitness Just like last year(2020), I‚Äôm still using a Mi Band to track most of my activity and I won‚Äôt lie this year there was no activity. In 2020, I had planned to walk around 5000 steps every day and was successful in doing that. But in 2021 I didn‚Äôt do any sort of exercise or walking or anything at all. I wonder if that is the reason for an exponential increase in my body weight üòÇ.\nBut I‚Äôm proud to say that I‚Äôve kept my consistency in sleep. In 2020, my average daily sleep was around 6 hours 30 minutes. And the number is almost the same this year as well.\n2021 2020 The monthly average has gone down for some reason. But still sleeping approx 7 out of 30 days is a decent amount of sleep.\nMovies \u0026 T.V Shows I‚Äôve continued to use trakt.tv to track all my watchings. This year also I used the same script(Thanks to the maintainer for maintaining the code) to export my data. But this year instead of using the imdbpy package I decided to use the PyTrakt package, mostly because trakt package did the job with higher accuracy and speed.\nNow looking at some data, I spent around 58 hours watching movies and 672 hours watching T.V Shows. That‚Äôs approximately 30 days. This total has gone up as compared to 2020 because in 2020 I spent around ~26 days watching tv shows and movies.\nGoing a bit deeper and focusing on the genre of the movies, this year my focus was more towards the action movies as compared to 2020 where I watched mostly comedy movies. I think it shows the action as the most-watched genre because this year we got some good action movies like Black Widow, Wrath of Man, Sang chi and my favorite from this year, Nobody. I probably loved ‚ÄúNobody‚Äù because the concept behind the movie was pretty similar to John Wick. And I absolutely love all John Wick movies.\nWhen we look at the most TV genre watched in 2021, the top 3 genres are exactly the same as that of 2020. Drama is still on top maybe because of shows like Loki, Peaky Blinders, Black Mirror, Jett, Atypical and many more. But the romance genre has gone all the way down. I don‚Äôt even recall which movie I watched under this genre.\nWe can see that I‚Äôve watched the majority of shows towards the end of August and early September, that is because that was the time when I was on a sort of ‚Äúvacation‚Äù üòÑ. One weird thing this year is that almost on all days I‚Äôve watched something whether it was just for 30 minutes or an hour. It feels weird because I actually don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs actually true but I‚Äôm just going to assume that the data doesn‚Äôt lie and I didn‚Äôt mess up during the analysis.\nArticles and Book For keeping track of all the books that I read, I use goodread. For 2021 I had set the 30 book challenge and I‚Äôm happy that I was able to complete it, even though 1 out of those 30 was a children‚Äôs book which only had 38 pages üòÇ.\nI really enjoyed reading almost all of them but if I have to list the top 5 books read this year, then I would say:\nThe Happiest Man on Earth A Man called Ove Of Mice and Men Outliers: The Story of Success Yellow Kid Weil I will highly recommend the first two books. I wouldn‚Äôt go into detail about them or even give their summary because I feel that a website like Goodreads would be a better option if you need a summary. But I would say that both of those books are exceptionally well written and have an awesome storyline.\nWhen I‚Äôm not reading any novels then I read articles which I saved using pocket.\nI spent 19 hours reading just articles. I feel 19 hours isn‚Äôt much and that‚Äôs because I spent more time reading books.\nMusic This year I started using Spotify and then connected it with my last.fm account. So no more hassle of getting the extra scrobbler and whatnot. And just like last year, I didn‚Äôt have to write any code to generate the following stats.\nThis year I‚Äôve consistently listened to music and podcasts and everything was on Spotify so a number of scrobbles have gone up.\nThe top albums have completely changed as compared to last year(2020). In 2020, the top 3 albums that I listened to were all from Eminem but this year it‚Äôs different artists and different albums. The funny thing is that my most listened-to song is ‚ÄúSuperChor‚Äù and that is probably because of its unique rap bridge. It‚Äôs very well written and amazingly performed by Akshay Verma and Dilbahar. I still remember I couldn‚Äôt stop listening to it for several days. And that is probably the reason I got the following:\nLet‚Äôs take a look at my listening clock:\n2021 2020 The interesting thing in this is that in 2020 I didn‚Äôt have very specific timing, we can see multiple peaks at 10-11 PM and 4-5 PM. But in 2021 I don‚Äôt have that, we can see that there is only 1 peak at around 11-12 PM. This is probably because towards the end of the year I mostly worked during those hours.\nAnd unlike last year, this year I have some data about all the podcasts that I listened to. Thanks to Spotify Wrapped.\nI really enjoyed listening to the Heist podcast. Matt and Simon were really amazing and very entertaining hosts. And they use to bring awesome heist stories. It‚Äôs really sad that they have decided to discontinue the podcast after their 200th episode. Moving on, I don‚Äôt think I have to say anything at all about Darknet Diaries. It‚Äôs probably the best ‚Äúhacking‚Äù related podcast out there.\nBoth of those NOISER production podcasts, Real dictators and Short stories Of, are another example of me listening to the podcast because of an awesome host i.e Paul McGann. I don‚Äôt know whether it was the way he spoke or what it was but I just loved listening to historic events from his voice. I would highly recommend those to people interested in history and historic events.\nThe reason I started listening to, Son of Hitman was because in the summary I read that it was about Woody Harrelson‚Äôs father, who was a hitman. And I was like what!? Then I just listened to the whole thing and I really enjoyed it.\nPC \u0026 Phone Usage I have an android phone so there is no inbuilt screen time. And that is because I had a yearly paid subscription of App Usage. It is definitely a great app but not open source. I‚Äôm only using app usage because Activity watch android app is in the early stages of development. Once it‚Äôs available with proper support I‚Äôll start using that.\nI used the youtube app for 402 hours, that‚Äôs ~16 days. And this is just on the phone, I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôve spent around 25-30 days of the year just watching youtube(including time from the android app and on PC/laptop). If you think about it‚Äôs just absurd that I spent almost 1 month out of 12 watching youtube.\nI spent 64 days just using my phone that is more than 2 months out of 12 total months. ü§êü§ê\nMoving on to the PC usage. I use Activity Watch to keep track of all the applications I used and for how long, etc. It‚Äôs an open-source tool and is under active development.\nNot gonna lie seeing that I used Firefox around 900 hours isn‚Äôt shocking because almost everything is done using a browser. But it‚Äôs really interesting to see that out of the top 20 most used applications 7 of them are either games or gaming related.\nI spent 119 days on my PC i.e ~4 months out of 12. I think these are big numbers because we as humans spend most of our time either on a cell phone or on PC/Laptops.\nConclusion Now after looking at all the stats above if I have to summarise 2021 I think I would say:\nSpent almost 6 months out of 12 either on my phone or my PC. I didn‚Äôt do much health-wise and gained weight. Watched loads of TV shows and movies. Enjoyed reading some great books. And if I ignore all the stats and just think then some of the things that come to my head are:\nGot my OSCP Got an amazing fully remote job Got Google HoF So all in all this was a pretty good year.\nIf you‚Äôd like to play with your own data and do something similar then check out my year-in-review repository which has code for getting your data and generating the graph.\n","wordCount":"1666","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-12-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.mzfr.me/posts/2021-12-31-year-in-review-2021/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mzfr's blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.mzfr.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.mzfr.me accesskey=h title="mzfr's blog (Alt + H)">mzfr's blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://blog.mzfr.me/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.mzfr.me/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wiki.mzfr.me title=Notes><span>Notes</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.mzfr.me/ctf/ title=Writeups><span>Writeups</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Year In Review-2021</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2021</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;8 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#chess aria-label=Chess>Chess</a></li><li><a href=#sleep--fitness aria-label="Sleep &amp;amp; Fitness">Sleep & Fitness</a></li><li><a href=#movies--tv-shows aria-label="Movies &amp;amp; T.V Shows">Movies & T.V Shows</a></li><li><a href=#articles-and-book aria-label="Articles and Book">Articles and Book</a></li><li><a href=#music aria-label=Music>Music</a></li><li><a href=#pc--phone-usage aria-label="PC &amp;amp; Phone Usage">PC & Phone Usage</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Another year comes to an end.

But in <strong>2021</strong> I don&rsquo;t have that, we can see that there is only 1 peak at around 11-12 PM. This is probably because towards the end of the year I mostly worked during those hours.</p><p>And unlike last year, this year I have some data about all the podcasts that I listened to. Thanks to Spotify Wrapped.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/year-in-review/2021/podcasts.jpg alt></p><p>I really enjoyed listening to the <a href=https://www.heistpodcast.com/>Heist podcast</a>. Matt and Simon were really amazing and very entertaining hosts. And they use to bring awesome heist stories. It&rsquo;s really sad that they have decided to discontinue the podcast after their 200th episode. Moving on, I don&rsquo;t think I have to say anything at all about Darknet Diaries. It&rsquo;s probably the best &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; related podcast out there.</p><p>Both of those NOISER production podcasts, Real dictators and Short stories Of, are another example of me listening to the podcast because of an awesome host i.e Paul McGann. I don&rsquo;t know whether it was the way he spoke or what it was but I just loved listening to historic events from his voice. I would highly recommend those to people interested in history and historic events.</p><p>The reason I started listening to, Son of Hitman was because in the summary I read that it was about Woody Harrelson&rsquo;s father, who was a hitman. And I was like what!? Then I just listened to the whole thing and I really enjoyed it.</p><h1 id=pc--phone-usage>PC & Phone Usage<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pc--phone-usage>#</a></h1><p>I have an android phone so there is no inbuilt screen time. And that is because I had a yearly paid subscription of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a0soft.gphone.uninstaller&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US">App Usage</a>. It is definitely a great app but not open source. I&rsquo;m only using app usage because <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.activitywatch.android">Activity watch android app</a> is in the early stages of development. Once it&rsquo;s available with proper support I&rsquo;ll start using that.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/year-in-review/2021/app_usage.png alt></p><p>I used the youtube app for 402 hours, that&rsquo;s ~16 days. And this is just on the phone, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I&rsquo;ve spent around 25-30 days of the year just watching youtube(including time from the android app and on PC/laptop). If you think about it&rsquo;s just absurd that I spent almost 1 month out of 12 watching youtube.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/year-in-review/2021/total_phone_usage.png alt></p><p>I spent 64 days just using my phone that is more than 2 months out of 12 total months. ü§êü§ê</p><p>Moving on to the PC usage. I use <a href=https://activitywatch.net/>Activity Watch</a> to keep track of all the applications I used and for how long, etc. It&rsquo;s an open-source tool and is under active development.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/year-in-review/2021/pc_usage.png alt></p><p>Not gonna lie seeing that I used Firefox around 900 hours isn&rsquo;t shocking because almost everything is done using a browser. But it&rsquo;s really interesting to see that out of the top 20 most used applications 7 of them are either games or gaming related.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=/images/year-in-review/2021/total_pc_usage.png alt></p><p>I spent 119 days on my PC i.e ~4 months out of 12. I think these are big numbers because we as humans spend most of our time either on a cell phone or on PC/Laptops.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h1><p>Now after looking at all the stats above if I have to summarise 2021 I think I would say:</p><ul><li>Spent almost 6 months out of 12 either on my phone or my PC.</li><li>I didn&rsquo;t do much health-wise and gained weight.</li><li>Watched loads of TV shows and movies.</li><li>Enjoyed reading some great books.</li></ul><p>And if I ignore all the stats and just think then some of the things that come to my head are:</p><ul><li>Got my OSCP</li><li>Got an amazing fully remote job</li><li>Got Google HoF</li></ul><p>So all in all this was a pretty good year.</p><hr><p>If you‚Äôd like to play with your own data and do something similar then check out my <a href=https://github.com/mzfr/year-in-review>year-in-review</a> repository which has code for getting your data and generating the graph.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://blog.mzfr.me/tags/year-in-review/>year-in-review</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://blog.mzfr.me/posts/2022-07-24-arch-genie/><span class=title>¬´ Prev</span><br><span>Genie in a bottle</span></a>
