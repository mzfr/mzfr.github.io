Hi, My name is Mehtab Zafar, and I'm doing my master's at NUS. Previously, I was a product security engineer at Red Queen Dynamics, Inc. Other than that, I have extensive experience in Bug Bounties and have achieved significant success in this field. I am proud to be included in the "Hall of Fame" for several renowned companies, including GitHub, PayPal, Google, etc. 
In addition to my expertise in security, I possess over 4 years of experience in Python development. I have actively contributed my development skills to various open-source code projects. Furthermore, I have served as a developer and mentor with Google Summer of Code.
