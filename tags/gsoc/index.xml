      <description>This year I got selected for Google Summer of Code 2020 under The Honeynet Project. This year GSoC was very special for me because I finally got selected for the organization, for which I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get selected from past 2 years.
Background I got to know about Google Summer of Code back in 2018, when I learned that my elder brother has done it 3 years in a row.</description>

      <description>I got selected as a Google Summer of Code student in XBMC foundation (a.k.a Kodi) for the project [Static code analysis in Kodi&amp;rsquo;s addon-check tool](Static code analysis in Kodi&amp;rsquo;s addon-check tool). Result came out on April 23 09:30 PM IST. I know it was 2 months ago but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get myself to write about it - you can say I was &amp;ldquo;busy&amp;rdquo; ;)
What is GSoC ? Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.</description>
